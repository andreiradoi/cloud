* Message Ingest
  Two very similar methods:

** Webhook
** API

* Message Schemas

  For every message we need to find its Schema.

  1. Determine the provider format, is this a RockBlock, FK Raw, Twilio, Particle message, Twitter, etc...
     NOTE: Some message providers have a fixed Schema (Twitter)
  2. Decode message from a known format so we can locate Schema correlators:
       - Parsing known binary message formats.
       - Splitting CSVs into arrays.
       - Parsing JSON into a known object/map
  3. Use schema correlators from that information to build a SchemaId
  4. Lookup Schema using that SchemaId
  5. Set orphaned messages aside until they're able to be identified (that is until a new Schema is defined)
